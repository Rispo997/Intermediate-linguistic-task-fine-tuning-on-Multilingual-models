# Intermediate-linguistic-task-fine-tuning-on-Multilingual-models
The main goal of the thesis work was twofold, to shed light on the ongoing performances and quality issues of modern NLP approaches when applied to multi-language data scarce domains, and to propose an approach to mitigate such problems, trying to improve the results generated by the baseline models.  \
The proposed approach, named Intermediate Task Training, consists in introducing a supplementary training step in the training pipeline of models, by using tasks that are not strictly related to the target task.
